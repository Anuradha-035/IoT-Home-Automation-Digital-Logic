# IoT-Home-Automation-Digital-Logic
Developed an IoT-based home automation system using Arduino to control lights and fans based on inputs from PIR, LDR, and DHT11 sensors. Integrated relay modules and optional Bluetooth control. Implemented basic digital logic and power-saving techniques using interrupts and deep sleep modes.     
# IoT-Based Home Automation Using Digital Logic

This project demonstrates a simple home automation system using Arduino, digital logic, and Bluetooth communication. An LED is turned ON/OFF using commands sent via a mobile app over Bluetooth.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Bluetooth HC-05 Module
- LED
- Resistors
- Connecting wires

## 📲 How It Works
- Mobile app sends data (‘1’ or ‘0’) via Bluetooth
- Arduino reads data and turns LED ON/OFF accordingly

## 🧠 Features
- Remote control using Bluetooth
- Low power consumption
- Can be extended to control fans, bulbs, etc.
